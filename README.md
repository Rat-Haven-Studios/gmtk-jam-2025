## [Forgotten Paths](https://hutnerr.itch.io/forgotten-paths)
This was a collaborative game built together with [Koborooski](https://github.com/Koborooski) for the [GMTK Game Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2025). The theme for this game jam was "Loop". 

Forgotten Paths is a puzzle game, where you define a sequence of movement commands that constantly loop until the player is manually stopped or completes the puzzle.
