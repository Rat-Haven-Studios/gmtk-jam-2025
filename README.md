Forgotten Paths is a puzzle game built with Godot for the
[GMTK Game Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2025) by [Rat Haven Studios](https://github.com/Rat-Haven-Studios).
The theme for the jam was **"Loop"**.

The game revolves around defining a sequence of movement commands that continuously repeat until the player manually stops the loop or reaches the goal.

## How to Play
At it's core, the game is quite simple. You select a few movement commands and then click play. These will repeatedly loop until you either win or stop it manually. To complete a level, all of the enemies there must be slain.

Though it may sound easy, it get's pretty difficult! Especially on the levels that require rotations. Give it a chance! If you're truly stuck, there is a hints & solutions cheat sheet on the [itch.io](https://hutnerr.itch.io/forgotten-paths)
